# SENG102-Assignment1

In this assignment I solve the programming challenges in the Starting Out with C++ book by Tony Gaddis starting from page 802 to page 809.
Here are the descriptions of each challenge.

1. Date
   Design a class called Date. The class should store a date in three integers: month, day and year. There should be member functios to print the date in the following forms:
   12/25/2014
   December 25, 2014
   25 December 2014
   Demonstrate the class by writing a complete program implementing it.
   Input validation: Do not accept values for the day greater than 31 or less than 1. Do not accept values for the month greater than 12 or less than 1.
